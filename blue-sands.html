      <p class="intro">Hemingway never wrote a treatise on the art of writing fiction.
         He did, however, leave behind a great many passages in letters, articles and
         books with opinions and advice on writing. Some of the best of those were

      <p>Before he was a big game hunter, before he was a deep-sea fisherman,
         Ernest Hemingway was a craftsman who would rise very early in the morning and write.

         is one of the most influential of the 20th century.

         You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is
         write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know."
